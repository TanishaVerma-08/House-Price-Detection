# House-Price-Prediction
It is a Machine Learning Model used to predict house price using linear regression only.
The following code has been performed on Jupyter Notebook.
Here's a brief overview of the libraries I used in this project, which played a crucial role in its success:
<br>
NumPy: This fundamental library for numerical computing allowed me to efficiently work with large datasets and perform various mathematical operations.
</br>
Pandas: Pandas was my go-to for data manipulation and analysis. It made handling and cleaning the dataset a breeze, enabling me to extract meaningful insights.
<br>
Matplotlib: Matplotlib helped me visualize the data, making it easier to understand trends, patterns, and correlations. Clear and informative visualizations were key to this project's success.
</br>
Scikit-Learn: This machine learning library provided a wide range of tools for modeling and evaluating predictive algorithms. I used various regression models to predict house prices accurately.
<br>
Jupyter Notebook: Jupyter Notebook served as my interactive coding environment, allowing me to document my work step by step and share it with my team.
